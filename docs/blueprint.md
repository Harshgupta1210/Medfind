# **App Name**: MediFind

## Core Features:

- Doctor Listing: Display a paginated list of doctors with relevant information (name, specialization, photo, etc.) fetched from the backend API.
- Filtering and Sorting: Implement functional filters to narrow down the doctor list based on criteria such as specialization, location, availability, and other relevant parameters.
- API Endpoints: Implement REST APIs using Next.js API routes: one to add new doctors to a local JSON data file, and another to retrieve a paginated and filtered list of doctors, mimicking backend data fetching.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a clean white or light grey (#F5F5F5) for the background.
- Secondary color: A professional blue (#3498db) for headers and key elements.
- Accent: A teal or light blue (#4CAF50) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout, similar to the reference website, with clear sections for the header, filters, and doctor listings. Use a grid-based layout for the doctor cards.
- Utilize recognizable icons for filter options (e.g., location, specialization) and doctor information (e.g., availability, experience).
- Subtle transitions and animations for filter interactions and page loading to enhance user experience.
